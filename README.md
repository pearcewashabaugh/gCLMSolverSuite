A collection of code for solving the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation. Please read the introduction to my dissertation at http://www.pearcewashabaugh.com for an introduction to these equations and their importance.

Current usage:

- Open main.py and enter relevant initial data and mesh resolutions

- Run python main.py in a command line. Use Python 3. This will output the solutions.

- To plot the velocity field u, the vorticity w, or the Lagrangian trajectory eta, open plotter_u and 
adjust the input file to the corresponding variable. Then run python plotter_u.py in a command line.
